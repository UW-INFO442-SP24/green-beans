## Our Mission

Thrift Titans is a web application aimed to help budget-conscious Gen Z students in Seattle overcome barriers to second-hand shopping, so they can save money, contribute to the environment, and participate in sustainable practices. By making second hand shopping more accessible through our centralized information hub, Thrift Titans, students will be able to engage in sustainable practices and contribute to shaping a more sustainable world.
